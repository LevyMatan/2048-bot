## Implementations

### [C++ Implementation](cpp/README.md)

The C++ implementation focuses on performance optimization and is suitable for running large numbers of games or deep search algorithms. It leverages:

- Bitwise operations for efficient board representation
- Precomputed move tables
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Memory optimization techniques
- Heuristic weight tuning using evolutionary algorithms

### [Python Implementation](python/README.md)

The Python implementation prioritizes readability and ease of experimentation, making it ideal for prototyping new algorithms and strategies. It features:

- Clear, object-oriented design
- Simplified API for creating new player strategies
- Visualization tools
- Comprehensive test suite

## Features

- **Multiple AI Strategies:**  
  Both implementations offer various player types including:
  - Random players
  - Heuristic-based players (empty cells, monotonicity, smoothness, corner placement)
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search players

- **Modular Design:**  
  The project uses clearly separated modules for the game logic, board management, and player strategies, allowing easy experimentation.

- **Heuristic Weight Tuning:**
  The C++ implementation includes a dedicated program for tuning the weights used by the heuristic player. This uses an evolutionary algorithm to find optimal weight combinations that maximize game scores.
